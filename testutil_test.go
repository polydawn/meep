	Ok, this one is really wild.

	Stacks in earlier versions of go would report functions like this...

		meep/fixtures/stack2.go:9: fixtures.funcÂ·002

	And newer versions now format them like this:

		meep/fixtures/stack2.go:9: fixtures.BeesBuzz.func1

	(Notice that this only makes an appearance with unnamed funcs.)
	Now, the new version is totally super better, yes, yayy, more contextual
	information by a lightyear.

	But it means our tests either need to alias this part and switch on go versions,
	or... just not look at it.
	This function is to do the latter.
